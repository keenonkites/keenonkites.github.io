Tour de Suisse (GCQG54)
=======================
The perl script *tds-route-xml.pl* uses the gpx file containing the complete geocache **Tour de Suisse (GCQG54)** with all logs to create different gpx files used for the online map.

Procedure to create the gpx files needed for the online map
-----------------------------------------------------------
Short description
1. Import the gpx file containing the cache into GSAK
2. Use GSAK's Function *Get Recent Logs* to import all logs of the cache into the GSAK DB
3. Export GPX file again containing the Cache and all logs:
    - Filename (fix): tds.gpx
	- Location: same directory as the perl script
	- Number of logs to export: No Limit
	- Place alternate coordinates in log text
4. run the perl script *tds-route-xml.gpx*
    This creates the following files:
	- tds-route-complete.gpx: file containing tracks for each year of the cache's journey
	- tds-wpt-complete.gpx: file containing waypoints with the date and finder name where the cache was already
	- tds-wpt-position.gpx: containing the last position of the cache as a waypoint
	- tds-route-comlete.txt: not directly used for the online map: contains a list of all stops of the cache
5. Copy the following three gpx files into the map directories:
    - tds-route-complete.gpx
	- tds-wpt-complete.gpx
	- tds-wpt-position.gpx
